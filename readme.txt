Model Protofier is free open-source software for pre-processing .obj wavefront model files into a format requiring minimal processing by the Proto Engine. A 20-byte header gives maximum x, y, z, r, and number of vertices, and the remainder of the file is the exact bytes that should be sent to the graphics card VBO.
